// Write a function printNumbers which is given a start number and an end number. It will print the numbers from one to the other, one per line:
function printNum (num1, num2) {
    for (i = num1; i <= num2; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}

printNum(1, 10);

// don't need the let in front of the input/index(i) it will define itself?
